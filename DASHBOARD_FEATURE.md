- **Endpoints**: See API Endpoints section below

**JWT Authentication Middleware**
```python
async def get_current_driver(authorization: str = Header(None)):
    # Extracts Bearer token from header
    # Verifies token with verify_token()
    # Queries driver from database
    # Returns driver document or raises 401
```

### API Endpoints

#### GET `/api/v1/dashboard/stats`

}
```

## Known Limitations

1. **No Geolocation**: Current implementation doesn't filter by driver location
2. **Fixed Timer**: Assumes 30-second booking expiration (configurable in backend)
3. **No Push Notifications**: Booking updates require manual refresh or polling
4. **No Rejection**: Drivers can only accept or ignore (no explicit reject action)
5. **No Booking History**: Dashboard only shows pending requests
6. **No Navigation**: No map integration for turn-by-turn directions
7. **Mock Data Ready**: Backend expects `bookings` and `trips` collections to be set up

## Future Enhancements

1. **Push Notifications**
   - Real-time booking alerts via FCM/APNs
   - Sound and vibration for new requests
   - Background updates

2. **Geolocation Integration**

6. **Chat System**

## Dependencies

### Frontend
- **Existing**: `react-native`, `expo-router`, `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`, `axios`
- **No new dependencies required**

### Backend
- **Existing**: `fastapi`, `motor`, `pymongo`
- **No new dependencies required**

## Security Considerations

- **JWT Authentication**: All endpoints require valid Bearer token
- **Driver Isolation**: Drivers only see their own stats and available bookings
- **Token Verification**: `verify_token()` validates signature and expiration
- **Race Conditions**: First driver to accept wins (409 for others)
- **Expired Bookings**: Automatic filtering prevents accepting expired requests

---

**Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and ready for testing
**Next Steps**: Set up mock booking data and test end-to-end flow
