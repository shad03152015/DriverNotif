# Review Details Feature

## Overview

The Review Details screen is a new intermediate step in the driver registration flow that allows drivers to verify all their entered information before final submission. This feature improves data accuracy and user experience by providing a clear confirmation step.

## User Flow

### Updated Registration Process

```
1. Registration Form → 2. Review Details → 3. Submit → 4. Success Screen
```

**Step 1: Fill Registration Form**
- Driver enters all required information
- Uploads profile photo (optional)
- Validates all fields
- Taps "Review Details" button

**Step 2: Review Details Screen (NEW)**
- Driver sees all entered information displayed clearly
- Information organized in sections:
  - Profile Photo (if uploaded)
  - Personal Information
  - Driver's License
  - Contact Details
- Two action buttons:
  - **"Go Back & Edit"** - Returns to registration form with all data preserved
  - **"Confirm & Submit"** - Submits to backend API

**Step 3: Submission**
- Data sent to backend
- Profile photo uploaded
- Driver record created in MongoDB with status "pending"

**Step 4: Success Screen**
- Confirmation message displayed
- Timeline showing next steps
- Registration complete

## Technical Implementation

### Files Added/Modified

**New File:**
- `app/(auth)/review.tsx` - Review Details screen component

**Modified Files:**
- `app/(auth)/registration.tsx` - Changed to navigate to review instead of submitting directly
- `app/_layout.tsx` - Added review screen to navigation stack
- `README.md` - Updated documentation with new flow

### Navigation Flow

```typescript
// Registration screen
onSubmit = (data) => {
  router.push({
    pathname: '/(auth)/review',
    params: {
      data: JSON.stringify(formData),
      photoUri: photoUri
    }
  });
};

// Review screen
handleSubmit = async () => {
  await registerDriver(formData);
  router.replace('/(auth)/success');
};

handleGoBack = () => {
  router.back(); // Returns to registration form
};
```

### Data Flow

1. **Registration Form → Review Screen**
   - Form data serialized as JSON and passed via route params
   - Photo URI passed separately
   - Form validation completed before navigation

2. **Review Screen → Backend API**
   - Form data reconstructed from params
   - Profile photo attached to multipart request
   - API call with authentication headers
   - Error handling with user feedback

3. **Backend → Success Screen**
   - On successful submission, navigate to success
   - Driver record created with status "pending"
   - Manual approval workflow continues in backend
